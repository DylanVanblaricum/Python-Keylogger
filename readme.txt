This is a very simple and rudimentary keylogger using the Pynput python library.
Use "pip install pynput" in Powershell for Windows to install the pynput library.

This is a real keylogger and will be detected by Windows Security and other antivirus software and must be added as an exclusion to work.

How to configure:
Simply change the location of the log directory in the .py file in line 6 to wherever you want the keylog.txt file to appear in and run the .py file in Python to begin keylogging.
